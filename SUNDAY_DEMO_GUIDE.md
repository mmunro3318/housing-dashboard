## Demo Script (20 minutes)

### Opening (2 min)

**Say this**:
> "I've created a clickable prototype to show you what the new system could look like. This uses fake data only - none of your real tenant information. Think of this as a preview of the future workflow. I want your honest feedback on what works, what doesn't, and what's missing."

### Dashboard Walkthrough (5 min)

**Open**: `prototype/index.html`

**Point out**:
1. **Top metrics**: "At a glance, you see total beds, how many are occupied, how many are available, and your occupancy rate."
2. **Properties table**: "Quick overview of all your properties with bed counts and occupancy."
3. **Voucher alerts**: "System automatically shows you which vouchers are expiring soon - no more manual tracking."
4. **Available beds**: "See open beds across all properties without searching through Excel."

**Ask**:
- "Does this give you the information you need to start your day?"
- "What's missing from this view?"

### Properties & Beds (5 min)

**Click**: "Properties" in navigation

**Point out**:
1. **Property cards**: "Each property shows its occupancy stats."
2. **Bed grid**: "Color-coded status - green is available, gray is occupied, yellow is pending."
3. **Click a bed**: Click an occupied bed to show tenant details popup

**Ask**:
- "Is this bed visualization clear? Does it make sense?"
- "What would you want to do when you click a bed?"
- "How do you currently track which room is which? Should we change the room numbering?"

### Tenant Management (5 min)

**Click**: "Tenants" in navigation

**Point out**:
1. **Search bar**: Type a name or DOC number
2. **Filters**: Show payment type and status filters
3. **Table data**: Point out bed assignment, payment info, balance

**Ask**:
- "Is this easier than searching through Excel?"
- "What other information do you need to see about each tenant?"
- "How often do you look up tenant information?"

### Intake Form (3 min)

**Click**: "Intake Form" in navigation

**If possible, open on phone**: Show mobile responsiveness

**Point out**:
1. **Simple fields**: "Tenants fill this out themselves"
2. **Payment type selector**: Change it to show voucher fields appearing
3. **Submit**: Fill out and submit to show success message

**Ask**:
- "Would your tenants be able to complete this form?"
- "Do they all have smartphones?"
- "What information is missing from this form?"

---

## Key Questions to Ask

### Data & Fields
1. **Property addresses**: "Your Excel uses numbers (1, 2, 3). Should we use actual street addresses?"
2. **Missing fields**: "Looking at this, what information do you track that isn't shown here?"
3. **Payment types**: "I see Private, Voucher, ERD, Family Support in your Excel. Are there others?"

### Workflow
4. **Daily routine**: "Walk me through your typical day. What do you check first?"
5. **Reports**: "What reports do you create most often? What's in them?"
6. **Contacts**: "Do you need to track case managers, CCOs, counselors, etc.?"

### Priorities
7. **Most important**: "If you could only have 3 features working, what would they be?"
8. **Nice to have**: "What features would be nice but aren't critical?"
9. **Alerts**: "Besides voucher expirations, what else should the system alert you about?"

### Technical
10. **Access**: "Will you only access this from your computer, or do you need it on your phone too?"
11. **Internet**: "Do you always have reliable internet access?"
12. **DOC integration**: "How do you currently find out when someone is being assigned to your properties?"

## Handling Common Questions

**"How much will this cost?"**
> "Let's first make sure we're building exactly what you need. Once we finalize the requirements, I can give you an accurate estimate."

**"When will it be ready?"**
> "For the basic version with property tracking, tenant management, and the intake form - probably 6-8 weeks of development. But let's confirm the scope first."

**"Can it do [X feature]?"**
> "Absolutely, we can add that. Let me note that down and we'll prioritize it along with the other features."

**"I don't understand the tech stuff"**
> "You don't need to! Your job is to tell me what you need to track and how you work. My job is to build it in a way that makes sense for you."

**"What if I need to change something later?"**
> "The system is flexible. We'll build the core features first, then add and adjust based on how you actually use it."

## Demo Tips

### Do
- ‚úÖ Go slow, let her explore
- ‚úÖ Ask open-ended questions
- ‚úÖ Write down everything she says
- ‚úÖ Show enthusiasm for her feedback
- ‚úÖ Acknowledge when you don't know something

### Don't
- ‚ùå Rush through pages
- ‚ùå Get defensive about design choices
- ‚ùå Over-explain the technology
- ‚ùå Promise features on the spot without thinking
- ‚ùå Interrupt when she's thinking

---

## Emergency Troubleshooting

**"The prototype won't load"**
- Make sure you're opening `index.html` directly in browser (not trying to load from a server)
- Try a different browser (Chrome recommended)

**"Data looks weird"**
- Remind her it's fake data for demo purposes
- Focus on the layout and workflow, not the specific values

**"I can't click something"**
- Some buttons are placeholders (Edit, Delete, etc.)
- Explain: "In the real app, this would [do X]. For the demo, we focused on the main workflows."
