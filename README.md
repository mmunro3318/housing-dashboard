# Halfway Housing Dashboard

## Problem Statement

Managing a network of halfway houses with diverse programs and residents creates complex data challenges. The current workflow relies on chaotic, multi-tabbed Excel files with inconsistent formats, manual entry, and limited reporting, which slows down intake, tracking, and housing coordination.

## Solution

This project delivers a secure, user-friendly dashboard solution. Residents can submit their data and managers can track bed assignments, rent/voucher payments, waitlists, and contacts in a single place. Real-time dashboards, robust reporting, and backup/export features streamline organization, reduce errors, and enable data-driven decisions.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React (with RTK-Query/Redux for data management)
- Backend: Node.js (Express)
- Database: Supabase (Postgres)
- Hosting: Vercel (frontend), Supabase cloud (database)
- Version Control: GitHub/GitLab

## Features

- CRUD operations for residents, houses, beds
- Central manager dashboard
- Resident intake form
- Secure role-based access
- Data backup/export (Google Sheets, CSV)
- _Planned_: Rent/payment ledger, program contacts, reporting, automated alerts and reports
- _Planned_: Generate reports and documents grounded in data for grants and non-profit reporting
- _Stretch_: DOC stakeholders can register `.[wa].doc1.gov` addresses to receive monthly reports on available bed spaces
