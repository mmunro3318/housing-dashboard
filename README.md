# Halfway Housing Dashboard

## Problem Statement

Managing a network of halfway houses with diverse programs and residents creates complex data challenges. The current workflow relies on chaotic, multi-tabbed Excel files with inconsistent formats, manual entry, and limited reporting, which slows down intake, tracking, and housing coordination.

## Solution

This project delivers a secure, user-friendly dashboard solution. Residents can submit their data and managers can track bed assignments, rent/voucher payments, waitlists, and contacts in a single place. Real-time dashboards, robust reporting, and backup/export features streamline organization, reduce errors, and enable data-driven decisions.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React with Vite, Tailwind CSS, React Router
- State Management: TanStack React Query (formerly React Query)
- Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL with Row Level Security)
- Hosting: Vercel (frontend), Supabase Cloud (database)
- Version Control: GitHub/GitLab (dual remote strategy)

## Features

### Implemented (Read-Only Phase)
- **Dashboard Page**: Real-time metrics displaying total beds, occupancy rate, available beds
- **Properties Overview**: Detailed view of all houses with bed counts, occupancy, and monthly income calculations
- **Tenants Page**: Searchable and filterable tenant list with status indicators
- **Properties Page**: Full property management with financial tracking (monthly income by house)
- **Voucher Expiration Alerts**: Widget showing tenants with vouchers expiring within 30 days
- **Pending Arrivals**: Tracks tenants scheduled to move in within the next 30 days
- **Available Beds List**: Quick-reference list with clickable links to Properties page

### Planned (Future Phases)
- Full CRUD operations for residents, houses, and beds
- Resident intake form with mobile optimization
- Secure role-based authentication
- Data backup/export (Google Sheets, CSV)
- Rent/payment ledger and transaction history
- Program contacts and counselor management
- Automated alerts and reports
- Grant reporting and document generation
- DOC stakeholder portal for bed availability reports

**Architecture:** Vercel-native monorepo with client-side data fetching
- Single `package.json` for both frontend and backend
- Frontend builds with Vite to `/dist`
- Data fetching: Direct Supabase client calls via @supabase/supabase-js (no backend API layer yet)
- State management: TanStack React Query for server state caching and synchronization
- Routing: React Router v7 with Layout-based navigation
- Styling: Tailwind CSS with custom purple/pink brand theme
- Backend: Vercel Serverless Functions in `/api` folder (planned for future CRUD operations)
- Automatic deployments on every push to GitHub

See [docs/architecture/directory-structure.md](docs/architecture/directory-structure.md) for detailed structure documentation.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Git
- Vercel account (free tier)
- Supabase account (free tier)

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mmunro3318/housing-dashboard.git
   cd housing-dashboard
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create `.env` file**
   ```bash
   # Copy from .env.example (when available)
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   ```

4. **Run development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Opens http://localhost:3000
   ```

5. **Build for production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   # Output: ./dist folder
   ```

### Deployment

The app automatically deploys to Vercel on every push:
- **Production:** Push to `main` branch
- **Preview:** Push to any feature branch

See [docs/deployment/vercel-setup.md](docs/deployment/vercel-setup.md) for detailed deployment instructions.

## Running the Prototype

**Note:** The static HTML prototype (`/prototype` folder) was used for Phase 1 requirements gathering. The production application is now being built with React + Vite.

To view the prototype:
```bash
cd prototype
# Open index.html in your browser
```
