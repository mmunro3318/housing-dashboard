- prototype/intake-form.html (will update after Sunday feedback)
- prototype/*.html (no changes until client validates requirements)

---

## Key Decisions Made

### 1. Voucher Rate Handling ✅
**Decision**: Use configurable `system_settings` table, NOT hardcoded values
**Rationale**: Rates change; manager needs ability to update via dashboard
**Implementation**: `voucher_rate` setting, default $700/month

### 2. Epic 3.1 Priority ✅
**Decision**: Move Payment & Voucher Management to MVP Phase 1
**Rationale**: Rent tracking is core business metric, critical for financial visibility
**Impact**: Adds ~1 week to MVP Phase 1 timeline

### 3. Tenant Type Classification ✅
**Decision**: Use TEXT[] array, allow multiple types per tenant
**Rationale**: Tenants can be both DOC AND TeleCare simultaneously
**Implementation**: `tenant_types` field with values: ['DOC', 'TeleCare', 'Private']

### 4. Gender Field Sensitivity ✅
**Decision**: Optional field, warnings not hard blocks, transgender-sensitive
**Rationale**: Compliance needs vs. inclusivity; manager retains final say
**Implementation**: Nullable `gender` field, soft validation only

### 5. "Batter's Box" Feature ✅
**Decision**: Post-MVP (Epic 6.1)
**Rationale**: Complex edge case, doesn't happen often, workaround exists (notes field)
**Alternative**: Use "Pending" status + notes for now

## Action Items for Sunday Demo

### Questions to Ask Client
1. What counties are your properties in?
2. Do you plan multi-county expansion?
3. What % of tenants are DOC vs TeleCare vs Private?
4. Current voucher rate? Does it change often?
5. How often do you relocate tenants?
6. Any houses with gender restrictions?
7. How far in advance do you know ERD releases?

### Documents to Review with Client
1. **SCHEMA_UPDATES.md** - Walk through new fields (non-technical summary)
2. **PRODUCT_SPEC.md** Section 6 - Data Schema (User-Friendly Version)
3. Prototype (as-is, note that intake form will be enhanced)

### Changes to Make After Sunday
Based on client feedback:
- Update intake form prototype with conditional fields (if approved)
- Refine Epic priorities if needed
- Adjust schema if additional fields discovered

---

## Technical Debt / Future Considerations

### Not Addressed Yet
- Multi-manager accounts (out of scope for MVP)
- DOC system integration (manual process acceptable)
- Mobile native apps (web-only for MVP)
- Document storage (leases, contracts)
- Maintenance tracking

### To Discuss in Sprint Planning
- Frontend framework decision (React confirmed, TypeScript?)
- State management approach (RTK Query vs React Query vs Zustand)
- Testing strategy (unit, integration, e2e)
- CI/CD pipeline setup

---

## Risk Assessment Updates

### New Risks Identified
1. **Scope Expansion**: Epic 3.1 added to Phase 1 increases timeline
   - **Mitigation**: Client approved, expectations set
2. **Schema Complexity**: More fields = more migration complexity
   - **Mitigation**: SCHEMA_UPDATES.md has detailed migration plan
3. **Tenant Type Edge Cases**: Multiple program affiliations may have unexpected interactions
   - **Mitigation**: Thorough testing with fake data before real migration

### Risks Mitigated
1. **Hardcoded Voucher Rates**: Now configurable via system_settings
2. **Single-County Limitation**: County field added for future expansion
3. **Inflexible Intake Form**: Dynamic conditional fields support multiple tenant types
