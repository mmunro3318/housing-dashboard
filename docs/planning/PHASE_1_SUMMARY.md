## Sunday Demo Plan

### Demo Flow (15-20 minutes)

1. **Introduction (2 min)**

   - Explain this is a clickable prototype with fake data
   - Show how it replaces Excel workflow

2. **Dashboard Tour (5 min)**

   - Start at `index.html`
   - Walk through metrics cards
   - Show properties table
   - Highlight voucher expiration alerts
   - Point out available beds section

3. **Properties Deep Dive (5 min)**

   - Click to `properties.html`
   - Show property cards with stats
   - Demonstrate color-coded bed grid
   - Click a few beds to show tenant details
   - Explain status meanings (Available/Occupied/Pending/Hold)

4. **Tenant Management (5 min)**

   - Navigate to `tenants.html`
   - Demonstrate search functionality
   - Show filtering by payment type and status
   - Point out balance tracking
   - Explain how rent owed is calculated

5. **Intake Form (3 min)**
   - Open `intake-form.html` on phone (or resize browser)
   - Show mobile-responsive design
   - Walk through form sections
   - Submit form to show success message

### Questions to Ask

**About the Data**:

1. Are there any fields we're missing that you need to track?
2. Is the bed/room numbering system clear?
3. Do the payment types cover all your situations?

**About the Workflow**: 4. Does this dashboard layout make sense for your daily work? 5. What reports do you generate most often? 6. Would your tenants be able to fill out the intake form?

**About Priorities**: 7. What features are most critical for you to have first? 8. Are there any features shown here that you don't actually need?

### Documents to Share

1. **SCHEMA_FOR_MANAGER.md** - Review data fields together
2. **Prototype** - Let her click through herself
3. Take notes on feedback for Phase 2 refinement

## Next Steps (After Sunday)

### Immediate (Monday-Tuesday)

1. Review feedback notes
2. Update PRODUCT_SPEC.md with clarifications
3. Refine priorities based on manager input
4. Answer open questions documented in spec

### Phase 2 (Week of Oct 21)

1. Break MVP Phase 1 epics into detailed user stories
2. Estimate story points
3. Set up GitHub Project board
4. Create Supabase project and database tables
5. Plan first 2-3 development sprints

### Development Start (Week of Oct 28)

1. Sprint 1: Data migration + Backend API
2. Sprint 2: Frontend CRUD operations
3. Sprint 3: Tenant intake form + notifications

---

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Tech Stack Confirmed**:

   - Frontend: React + Vite + JavaScript + Tailwind CSS
   - Backend: Node.js + Express
   - Database: Supabase (Postgres)
   - Hosting: Vercel (frontend), Supabase cloud (backend)

2. **MVP Scope**:

   - Focus on core CRUD operations first
   - Intake form as second priority
   - Payment tracking in Phase 2
   - AI features post-MVP

3. **Data Strategy**:

   - Use fake data for all demos and development
   - Migrate real data only after manager approval
   - Store Excel file as backup before migration

4. **Agile Approach**:
   - 2-week sprints
   - Story point estimation
   - Regular feedback loops with manager
