# Session 5 --

## User

Okay, the changes aren't visible on the Vercel deployment yet (but I checked, and the push was successful to GitHub). I'll check again in a bit. Let's plan out our next steps. I noticed in the compacting history, you were thinking of seeding the database with test data and adding some frontend components before we set up the CI/CD pipeline. Is that still your plan, or CI/CD first? I'm ignorant of CI/CD and will need your help setting it up (and to know when in development it's appropriate to do so).

## Claude

● Great question! Let me explain when and why to set up CI/CD, since you mentioned you're new to it.

CI/CD: What It Automates

CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) automates repetitive tasks:

- Running tests on every commit
- Checking code quality (linting)
- Building and deploying automatically
- Running database migrations

The key question: What repetitive tasks do we have right now?

Answer: Not many yet! We don't have:

- Test suites to run
- Multiple developers pushing code simultaneously
- Complex build processes beyond Vite's default

Recommended Order: Build First, Automate Later

Here's the typical development flow:

1. Build core functionality (manual testing)
   ↓
2. Establish patterns and workflows
   ↓
3. Find repetitive pain points
   ↓
4. Write automated tests for those areas
   ↓
5. Set up CI/CD to run those tests automatically

Why this order?

- Hard to automate what doesn't exist yet
- You need manual experience to know what's worth automating
- Tests are more valuable once you have working code to protect from regressions

My Recommendation: Seed Data + Frontend First

Next steps I suggest:

1. Seed database with test data (30 mins)

   - Create 3-5 houses
   - Create 10-15 beds across those houses
   - Create 5-10 tenants with various statuses
   - Gives us realistic data to work with

2. Build first frontend component (1-2 hours)

   - Start simple: "Houses List" view
   - Fetches houses from Supabase
   - Displays in a table with address, total beds, occupied beds
   - Maybe add "View Details" button for each house

3. Manual testing (ongoing)

   - Click around, find bugs, iterate
   - Get comfortable with the workflow
   - Identify what's painful or repetitive

4. Manual testing (ongoing)

   - Click around, find bugs, iterate
   - Get comfortable with the workflow
   - Identify what's painful or repetitive

5. THEN set up CI/CD (after we have tests worth running)

   - By then we'll know what to automate
   - You'll have context for why CI/CD is helpful

When CI/CD Makes Sense for This Project

You'll know it's time for CI/CD when:

- ✅ You're running the same manual tests repeatedly
- ✅ You have test files (.test.js) you want to run automatically
- ✅ Multiple people are working on the codebase (you + classmate?)
- ✅ You want to catch bugs before they reach production

For your class project, CI/CD is a nice-to-have, not a must-have. But it's great learning experience!

---

So, shall we:

1. Create seed data script to populate the database with test houses/beds/tenants?
2. Build a simple "Houses List" component to display that data?
3. Save CI/CD for after we have working features to protect?

Let me know if you want to proceed with this plan, or if you have other priorities!

## User

Okay -- I agree with your reasoning. Let's first generate test data and seed it to the database. Then we'll work on some frontend components. First, we'll need the test data. It will be different than the test data we used in the prototype because we've added new fields and tables. I'm going to put you in planning mode, and we'll stick to just seed data and upload first. Then in a new session we'll work on frontend components.

## Claude

● I'll research the schema and existing data patterns to create a comprehensive plan for generating and seeding test data.

│ Test Data Generation & Seeding Plan │
│ │
│ Overview │
│ │
│ Create a JavaScript seed script to generate realistic test data and populate all 8 Supabase tables with proper relationships and constraints. │
│ │
│ What We'll Build │
│ │
│ 1. Install Dependencies │
│ │
│ npm install @faker-js/faker dotenv --save-dev │
│ │
│ 2. Create Seed Script Structure │
│ │
│ scripts/ │
│ ├── seed-database.js # Main orchestrator │
│ ├── generators/ │
│ │ ├── houses.js # 5 Seattle houses │
│ │ ├── beds.js # 40-45 beds across houses │
│ │ ├── tenants.js # 30-35 tenants (occupied, exited, waitlist) │
│ │ ├── tenant-profiles.js # 1:1 profiles with recovery/legal info │
│ │ ├── emergency-contacts.js # 1-3 contacts per tenant │
│ │ ├── form-submissions.js # Application + Intake forms │
│ │ └── policy-agreements.js # 10 policy signatures per Intake │
│ └── README.md # Usage documentation │
│ │
│ 3. Data Generation Strategy │
│ │
│ Realistic Patterns (based on prototype data): │
│ - Houses: 5 Seattle addresses (Pine St, Broadway, Madison, Summit, add 1 new) │
│ - Beds: Room numbering "Room 1A", "Room 1B", etc., base_rent $700-800 │
│ - Tenants: Mix of payment types (40% Voucher, 30% ERD, 20% Private, 10% Family) │
│ - Profiles: 60-70% in recovery, 30% probation, 40% parole, DOC numbers for all │
│ - Contacts: 1-3 per tenant, relationships (Mother, Father, Sibling, Case Manager) │
│ - Forms: Application (all tenants) + Intake (60% of tenants) │
│ - Policies: 10 sections for each Intake form with Base64 signature placeholders │
│ │
│ Test Scenarios Included: │
│ - 60-70% occupied beds │
│ - 25-30% available beds │
│ - 5% pending beds │
│ - 20% exited tenants │
│ - 10% waitlist tenants │
│ - Some tenants behind on rent │
│ - Some expired vouchers │
│ │
│ 4. Insertion Order (Handle Circular FKs) │
│ │
│ 1. Insert houses (no dependencies) │
│ 2. Insert beds with tenant_id = NULL (depends on houses) │
│ 3. Insert tenants with bed_id set (depends on beds) │
│ 4. UPDATE beds.tenant_id for occupied beds (resolve circular FK) │
│ 5. Insert tenant_profiles (depends on tenants) │
│ 6. Insert emergency_contacts (depends on tenants) │
│ 7. Insert form_submissions (depends on tenants) │
│ 8. Insert policy_agreements (depends on tenants + form_submissions) │
│ │
│ 5. Environment Setup │
│ │
│ Create .env.local (not committed): │
│ SUPABASE_URL=https://tmdnfwbiputrylayovjl.supabase.co │
│ SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<your-service-role-key> │
│ │
│ Use service_role_key (bypasses RLS for seeding). │
│ │
│ 6. Key Features │
│ │
│ - UUID generation: Use crypto.randomUUID() │
│ - Faker integration: Realistic names, addresses, phones, dates │
│ - Date logic: entry_date < voucher_start < voucher_end, consistent exit dates │
│ - Payment calculations: rent_due based on months since entry, rent_paid slightly less for some │
│ - JSONB form data: JSON templates matching field-mapping.md structure │
│ - Signature placeholders: Base64-encoded placeholder strings │
│ - Error handling: Try/catch with rollback on failure │
│ - Logging: Console output showing progress and record counts │
│ │
│ 7. Script Execution │
│ │
│ cd scripts │
│ node seed-database.js │
│ │
│ Expected output: │
│ ✓ Inserted 5 houses │
│ ✓ Inserted 42 beds │
│ ✓ Inserted 32 tenants │
│ ✓ Updated 25 occupied beds │
│ ✓ Inserted 32 tenant profiles │
│ ✓ Inserted 58 emergency contacts │
│ ✓ Inserted 38 form submissions │
│ ✓ Inserted 140 policy agreements │
│ 🎉 Database seeded successfully! │
│ │
│ 8. Verification Steps │
│ │
│ After seeding: │
│ 1. Check Supabase dashboard for record counts │
│ 2. Verify foreign key relationships (no orphaned records) │
│ 3. Test frontend connection (should display houses/beds/tenants) │
│ 4. Verify data quality (realistic values, no null violations) │
│ │
│ 9. Reset Database (If Needed) │
│ │
│ -- Run in Supabase SQL Editor to wipe and re-seed │
│ TRUNCATE houses, beds, tenants, tenant_profiles, emergency_contacts, │
│ form_submissions, policy_agreements RESTART IDENTITY CASCADE; │
│ │
│ Then re-run node seed-database.js. │
│ │
│ Next Session │
│ │
│ After seeding is complete, we'll build frontend components to display this data (Houses List, Tenant Dashboard, etc.).

## User

Your plan generally looks sound, but I have a few questions. We already have a `.env` file with our url/api keys... what is the distinction between the `.env` and a `.env.local` file?

Dependencies -- do we only need to install the single faker dependency? I don't want a cascade of `npm install`s later.

After you answer those, produce a todo checlkist in chat to guide us as we proceed.

## Claude

● Great questions! Let me clarify:

.env vs .env.local

Short answer: You can just use your existing .env file! No need for .env.local.

Explanation:

- .env - Standard environment file (already in your .gitignore, so it's safe)
- .env.local - Vite-specific convention that has higher priority than .env

Since your .env is already in .gitignore (standard practice), just add the service role key to your existing .env file:

# Your existing .env file

VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://tmdnfwbiputrylayovjl.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGc...

# Add this line for seed script:

SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<your-service-role-key>

Why service role key? The seed script needs to bypass RLS policies to insert data, so we use the service role key (which has admin privileges). The anon key respects RLS, which would block our inserts.

---

Dependencies

You'll need to install 2 packages (one-time only):

npm install @faker-js/faker dotenv --save-dev

What they do:

1. @faker-js/faker - Generates realistic fake data (names, addresses, dates, etc.)
2. dotenv - Loads .env file in Node.js scripts (Vite does this automatically for frontend, but Node.js scripts need it)

Already installed (from previous session):

- @supabase/supabase-js ✓ (already have this)

That's it! No cascade of installs. Faker is self-contained, and dotenv is tiny.

---

Todo Checklist for Test Data Seeding

Here's our step-by-step plan:

Phase 1: Environment Setup

- Add SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY to existing .env file (get from Supabase dashboard)
- Install dependencies: npm install @faker-js/faker dotenv --save-dev
- Create scripts/ directory in project root
- Create scripts/generators/ subdirectory

Phase 2: Create Generator Functions

- Create scripts/generators/houses.js - Generate 5 Seattle houses
- Create scripts/generators/beds.js - Generate 40-45 beds across houses
- Create scripts/generators/tenants.js - Generate 30-35 tenants with payment types
- Create scripts/generators/tenant-profiles.js - Generate profiles with DOC/recovery/legal data
- Create scripts/generators/emergency-contacts.js - Generate 1-3 contacts per tenant
- Create scripts/generators/form-submissions.js - Generate Application + Intake forms (JSONB)
- Create scripts/generators/policy-agreements.js - Generate 10 policy signatures per Intake

Phase 3: Create Main Seed Script

- Create scripts/seed-database.js - Main orchestrator script
- Add Supabase client initialization (using service role key)
- Add insertion logic in correct order (houses → beds → tenants → profiles → contacts → forms → policies)
- Handle circular FK updates (beds.tenant_id after tenants inserted)
- Add error handling and rollback logic
- Add progress logging (console output showing record counts)

Phase 4: Test & Verify

- Run seed script: node scripts/seed-database.js
- Check Supabase dashboard for record counts in all 8 tables
- Verify foreign key relationships (no orphaned records)
- Spot-check data quality (realistic values, dates make sense)
- Test frontend connection displays seeded data

Phase 5: Documentation

- Create scripts/README.md with usage instructions
- Document how to reset database and re-seed
- Add environment variable requirements

Phase 6: Git Commit

- Commit all seed scripts to repository
- Ensure .env is NOT committed (already in .gitignore)
- Push to both GitLab and GitHub

---

Estimated time: 1-2 hours for all generators + testing

Ready to start? Let me know and we'll begin with Phase 1!

## User

Okay -- go ahead and install the packages. I've already added the keys to `.env`, so we're ready to go there. Create the directory structure in `./scripts` -- we already have two Python files there we used for reading the Excel file and seeding test data for the HTML prototype. But ignore those for now (or archive in `./docs` as old scripts, to keep our directory clean). Stop before writing your generator functions -- I'll have some questions.

## Claude

● Perfect! Setup complete. Here's what I did:

✅ Phase 1 Complete

1. Installed Dependencies

✓ @faker-js/faker (added 48 packages)
✓ dotenv
✓ 0 vulnerabilities

2. Archived Old Scripts

Moved Python files to keep things clean:

2. Archived Old Scripts

Moved Python files to keep things clean:

- scripts/analyze_excel.py → docs/old-scripts/analyze_excel.py
- scripts/generate_fake_data.py → docs/old-scripts/generate_fake_data.py

3. Created Directory Structure

scripts/
└── generators/ (ready for generator files)

---

Current State

Your scripts/ directory is now clean and ready. Next up, we'll create 7 generator files in scripts/generators/:

1. houses.js
2. beds.js
3. tenants.js
4. tenant-profiles.js
5. emergency-contacts.js
6. form-submissions.js
7. policy-agreements.js

But first - what questions do you have? I'm stopping here as you requested so you can ask about the generator approach before I write any code.

## User

Before we write the data generator functions, I was wondering if this is a good time/place to write tests and take a TDD approach? It's just for test data, so it's not mission critical. But it could give me exposure to TDD design and workflows. This may be overkill now, so you can push back, and we can address it after some barebones frontend components.

## Claude

● Great instinct to think about testing! But I'm going to gently push back on TDD for this specific task. Here's my reasoning:

Why NOT to TDD the Seed Generators

1. One-Time Utility Scripts

These generators are temporary scaffolding:

- Run once to populate test data
- Maybe run again if we reset the database
- Not production code that needs regression protection
- Won't be maintained long-term

2. The Database IS the Test

When we run the seed script, we get immediate validation:

- ❌ Foreign key violations → script crashes with clear error
- ❌ Unique constraint violations → script crashes
- ❌ Check constraint violations → script crashes
- ✅ Success → data is in Supabase, ready to inspect

This is more thorough than any unit test could be!

3. Hard to Test Meaningfully

What would you test?

```js
// Trivial test - not very useful
test("generateHouses returns array of 5 houses", () => {
  const houses = generateHouses(5);
  expect(houses).toHaveLength(5);
  expect(houses[0]).toHaveProperty("address");
});
```

vs. what you actually care about:

- "Do these addresses look realistic?"
- "Are the dates logically consistent?"
- "Does the data work in the actual database?"

These require manual visual inspection even if tests pass.

4. Better Error Handling > Tests

For seed scripts, good error handling is more valuable:

```js
try {
  const { data, error } = await supabase.from("houses").insert(houses);
  if (error) throw error;
  console.log("✓ Inserted", data.length, "houses");
} catch (err) {
  console.error("❌ Failed to insert houses:", err.message);
  process.exit(1);
}
```

This tells you exactly what failed and why.

WHERE TDD Would Be Valuable (Coming Soon!)

Save TDD for your application code! Much better learning opportunities:

Example 1: Business Logic Functions

```js
// functions/calculateRentDue.js
export function calculateRentDue(tenant) {
const monthsOccupied = getMonthsSince(tenant.entry_date)
return tenant.actual_rent \* monthsOccupied
}


// calculateRentDue.test.js
test('calculates rent due for 3 months at $700/month', () => {
const tenant = { entry_date: '2024-07-28', actual_rent: 700 }
expect(calculateRentDue(tenant)).toBe(2100)
})
```

Example 2: React Component Tests

```js
// components/TenantList.test.jsx
test('displays "No tenants found" when list is empty', () => {
  render(<TenantList tenants={[]} />);
  expect(screen.getByText("No tenants found")).toBeInTheDocument();
});

test("displays tenant names when data is loaded", () => {
  const tenants = [{ id: 1, full_name: "John Doe" }];
  render(<TenantList tenants={tenants} />);
  expect(screen.getByText("John Doe")).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

Example 3: API Endpoint Tests

```js
// api/beds.test.js
test("GET /api/beds?status=Available returns only available beds", async () => {
  const response = await request(app).get("/api/beds?status=Available");
  expect(response.status).toBe(200);
  expect(response.body.every((bed) => bed.status === "Available")).toBe(true);
});
```

These tests protect critical business logic and user-facing features.

---

My Recommendation

For this session:

1. ✅ Write generators with good error handling
2. ✅ Run seed script and verify in Supabase dashboard
3. ✅ Fix any issues and iterate
4. ❌ Skip tests for seed generators

For NEXT session (frontend components):

1. ✅ Start with TDD! Write component tests first
2. ✅ Learn Jest/Vitest + React Testing Library
3. ✅ Practice red-green-refactor cycle
4. ✅ Build confidence in testing workflow

This way you get TDD experience on code that actually benefits from it, and the learning will be more applicable to real-world development.

---

Sound good? Should I proceed with writing the generator functions (with good error handling but no tests), and we'll dive into TDD when we build frontend components?

## User

Okay -- I appreciate you explaining. We'll save TDD for frontend components. Let's proceed with the generator functions.

## Claude

[writing scripts]

     🌱 Starting database seed...

     📋 Fetching system settings...
     ✓ System settings loaded: voucher_rate, telecare_rate, section8_rate

## User

Hmm... it looks like there was error, where the emergency contact didn't have a last name (`null`). I think the last name _should_ be required for contacts, so the table design is good. We just need to fix the seed script? Were there any other errors? Did this upload any data to the DB or fail entirely?

## Claude

● Good catch! Let me analyze what happened:

What Succeeded ✅

The script partially uploaded data before failing:

- ✓ 5 houses inserted
- ✓ 52 beds inserted
- ✓ 32 tenants inserted
- ✓ 31 occupied beds updated (circular FK resolved)
- ✓ 32 tenant profiles inserted

What Failed ❌

- ❌ Emergency contacts (failed during insertion)
- ❌ Form submissions (never reached)
- ❌ Policy agreements (never reached)

So you have houses, beds, tenants, and profiles in the database, but no contacts, forms, or policies.

---

The Bug

In `scripts/generators/emergency-contacts.js` line 38-44, I used faker.helpers.maybe() incorrectly:

```js
last_name: faker.helpers.maybe(
  () => tenant.full_name?.split(" ")[1] || faker.person.lastName(),
  { probability: 0.8 }
);
```

Problem: `faker.helpers.maybe()` returns undefined when it doesn't pass the probability check. With probability 0.2 (for non-family), there's an 80% chance it returns undefined → null in database → violates NOT NULL constraint.

---

● Perfect! Bug fixed. Now let's clean up and re-run.

---

Next Steps

Since you have partial data in the database, you need to wipe it clean before re-running. If you try to re-run now, you'll get duplicate key errors (houses/beds/tenants already exist).

1. Reset the Database

Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
TRUNCATE houses, beds, tenants, tenant_profiles, emergency_contacts,
form_submissions, policy_agreements RESTART IDENTITY CASCADE;
```

This will:

- Delete all data from these 7 tables
- Reset auto-increment sequences
- CASCADE ensures foreign key relationships are handled properly
- system_settings is NOT truncated (keeps your voucher rates)

2. Re-run the Seed Script

```bash
node scripts/seed-database.js
```

This time it should complete successfully! You should see:

✓ Inserted 65 emergency contacts ← This should work now!
✓ Inserted 38 form submissions
✓ Inserted 150 policy agreements
🎉 Database seeded successfully!

---

Were There Other Errors?

No, just the one last_name bug. I checked the other generators:

- ✅ houses.js - No required fields can be null
- ✅ beds.js - No required fields can be null
- ✅ tenants.js - Only full_name and dob are required (both always set)
- ✅ tenant-profiles.js - Only tenant_id is required (always set)
- ✅ form-submissions.js - All required fields always set
- ✅ policy-agreements.js - All required fields always set

The emergency contacts bug was the only one!

---

Ready to truncate and re-run? Let me know once you've run the TRUNCATE command, and I'll watch the seed script output with you.

## User

`Success. No rows returned` -- TRUNCATE ran successfully. Ready to re-run the seed generator.

## Claude

● 🎉 Success! Database Seeded Successfully!

Final Results

All 7 tables populated with test data:

- Form Submissions:
  - 32 Application forms (all tenants)
  - 31 Intake forms (occupied tenants)
- Policy Agreements: 10 signed policies per Intake form (310 total signatures)

---

Verification Steps

1. Check Supabase Dashboard

Go to Table Editor and verify:

- ✅ Houses table has 5 rows
- ✅ Beds table has 49 rows
- ✅ Tenants table has 32 rows
- ✅ Emergency contacts table has 65 rows
- ✅ Form submissions has JSONB data in form_data column

2. Test Frontend Connection

Restart dev server if it's running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `localhost:3000` - your connection test should still show green ✓

3. Spot Check Data Quality

- Click into a tenant record - should have realistic name, DOB, phone
- Check a bed record - should have tenant_id if occupied
- Look at form_submissions - form_data should have nested JSON structure

---

What's Next?

You now have real test data to work with!

For the next session, we'll build frontend components to display this data:

1. Houses List component (display all 5 houses)
2. Beds Dashboard (show occupied vs available)
3. Tenants Table (searchable, filterable)

But before we end this session, should we:

1. Commit all seed scripts to git (push to GitLab + GitHub)
2. Verify data in Supabase dashboard together
3. Or end session here and tackle frontend in the next one?

What would you like to do?

## User

Confirmed success through the Supabase Dashboard! Realistic and useful data to display the functionality of our housing dashboard! I wonder (in future, don't edit anything right now), should we extract CCO info into a separate table, similar to `emergency_contacts` -- particularly in the same house, you'll encounter scenarios where multiple tenants have the same CCO. Something to consider before we go live with Client data. But for test data, let's stick with it as is.

Confirmed with `npm run dev` that the app still builds successfully and connects to Supabase. However, I've noticed that our Vercel deployment never updated with our successful DB connection message (we pushed the commit last night). After our next commit, if the changes don't deploy after an hour or so, we may need to troubleshoot. Not critical while we're finishing up here, though.

Update all of our current documentation (be sure to check off tasks in the `project-roadmap.md` file, and add any if we missed a production step).

I think we should stage and commit all changes here, and push. Then I'll compact the session context, and we'll get started on frontend components. I'm going to review the epics and user stories. I think we should start taking an Agile approach and planning out sprints and tasks based on the stories we made in `PRODUCT_SPEC.md`. I strayed because I wanted to get some foundations done so we could set up the Vercel and Supabase deployment. Now that that's done, I think it's time to bring it back on track.
